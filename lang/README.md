# Localization

Follow our file format, otherwise this application cannot read your files.
We appreciate any help we can get to expand our Localization Database and make this application appeal to more people.

## File Layout (.json)

All language files are written in the JSON File Format.
It is pretty straight-forward.

{
    "key": "value",
    "key2": "value2"
}

All files need to have a 'name' key for this language's name and a 'code' key which must equal your file name.

Please refer to the English file for a list of all available / needed keys.
